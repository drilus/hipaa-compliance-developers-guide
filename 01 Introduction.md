# The Developers Guide to HIPAA Compliance

## Introduction
HIPAA, the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act), was passed in 1996, and among other things, outlines the requirements for the management of, storage and transmission of protected health information (PHI) in both physical and digital form. And while the original legislation pre-dates the rise of the commercial Internet (and the iPhone by a decade) its rules govern the use of this special type of personal data by applications on the web and mobile devices. 

With any twenty year old piece of legislation that was written in a world without smartphones, tablets, and heck, even webmail, HIPAA is full of requirements that are confusing and challenging, particularly for software developers who have to make sense of them as they relate to their product and the underlying technologies that we all use on a regular basis to build and deliver applications to our customer bases. 

#### 2013 Final Omnibus Rule Update 
In September of 2013, the [Final Omnibus Rule Update](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act#cite_note-33) was passed that amended HIPAA and greatly expanded the definition of who needed to be HIPAA compliant. Previously, only covered entities (such as doctors, hospitals, and insurers) were required to be HIPAA compliant. With the recent rule change however, all entities that store, manage, record or pass Protected Health Information (we'll just call it PHI from now on) to and from covered entities are also required to be HIPAA compliant. These entities, called Business Associates, who were previously exempt from HIPAA, now fall under its governance.
